               <p class="text-light text-justify">CECOS University has come a long way through the tortuous path in the domain of private sector universities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). It has the credit of pioneering the computer education in 1986, which eventually grew and developed into a multi disciplinary university offering Engineering (Civil, Electrical & Mechanical), Architecture, the only one in private sector in KPK, Management Sciences and Computer Sciences. A five year Bachelor degree program in architecture, four year degree program in Electronics, B.Tech in Civil, Electrical, Mechanical and an intensive M.S Program in Civil-Electrical Engineering along with Engineering Management and urban planning have further strengthened the academics system of CECOS.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="text-justify text-light">PhD program in Civil and Electrical Engineering have been launched. Provision of incentives to faculty members for research including financial and leave concession for M.S and PhD Studies, have greatly encouraged the faculty to pursue higher studies, which has certainly enhanced, and strengthened their capability and skill of teaching and research. In view of the lower female literary rate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, all female students are granted 20% concession in Tuition Fee.</p>
