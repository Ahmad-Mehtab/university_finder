               <p class="text-light text-justify">The Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Research Group (AM2RG) is the largest and probably broadest research group in the region that conducts multidisciplinary research in the fields of advanced materials, hybrid and assisted machining processes, bio-medical engineering, MEMS, Modeling and simulation, fabric materials, acoustic softening in advanced aerospace alloys, ultrasonic assisted forming, welding, lead free solder alloys and wear analysis of bio-medical/advanced materials using various engineering techniques including experimentation, analytical and numerical modeling in collaboration with many industrials and academic partners. Much of the work is cross-disciplinary and as such is conducted across multiple academic institutes and industrials partners both in Pakistan and internationally. Currently work is being done on numerous projects including various industrial projects ranging from advanced materials design to structure integrity of components and structure made from them at macro, micro and nano-scale.<br>

        <br>
               <p class="text-light text-justify">International Journal of Advanced Materials and Manufacturing is a bi-annual peer-reviewed journal that publishes research papers of original, significant and rigorous work in the broad area of mechanics of advanced materials, mechanics of processes, biomaterials, deformation of materials and machines applied to the manufacture of engineering components, mainly in metals, but also in composites, ceramics and other structural materials. IJAMM team is working closely with Thomson Reuters (ISI) to ensure that citation analysis of articles published in International journal of Advanced Materials and Manufacturing will be available. All submitted manuscripts are subjected to initial appraisal by the Editor, and if found suitable for further consideration, they are peer-reviewed by independent, anonymous expert referees.</p>
